### Hello!

<!--
**ardenBarden/ardenBarden** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I hooked up wakatime... https://wakatime.com/plugins/status?onboarding=true

Maybe consider coding C++ projects in here and transfer them over HEHE
Look at readmes of people you like and copy stuffies hehe. 
Get "pro" for free for being a student methinks

Consider Github desktop so that you can send changes direct to computer. If I do that, then I can make changes in an IDE I like, like eclipse or vscode

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...

My name is Arden Neff, and I'm an undergraduate Computational Mathematics major and Philosophy minor. My past work so far has not been as tantalizingly surveillable as I now realize it should have been (silly me). Stay tuned as I start to flesh out my coding life for the GitHopticon!

Until then, I am:

- President of the Texas Alpha chapter of the Alpha Chi national honor society
- Recipient of the 2024 Atkins Memorial Scholarship award as well as the 2025 Grogan Lord award, offered respectively to Southwestern University's singular top Comp Math and Computer Science student
- First place winner of the 2022 TAS convention's Mathematics and Computer Science poster section for my work optimizing harvest processes on a West Texas vineyard (ask me about my grapes!)
- Captain of Southwestern University's track and field team
- 2-year Computer Science tutor, both in introductory topics and data structures
- A member of the 2nd-place winning team in the ICPC South Central programming competition!
- Agtech data science intern at Plantible Foods
