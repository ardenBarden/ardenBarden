### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**ardenBarden/ardenBarden** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I hooked up wakatime... https://wakatime.com/plugins/status?onboarding=true

Maybe consider coding C++ projects in here and transfer them over HEHE
Look at readmes of people you like and copy stuffies hehe. 
Get "pro" for free for being a student methinks

Consider Github desktop so that you can send changes direct to computer. If I do that, then I can make changes in an IDE I like, like eclipse or vscode

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

My name is Arden Neff, and I'm an undergraduate Computational Mathematics major and Philosophy minor. My past work so far has not been as tantalizingly surveillable as I now realize it should have been (silly me). Stay tuned as I start to flesh out my coding life for the GitHopticon!

Until then, I am:

- President of the Texas Alpha chapter of the Alpha Chi national honor society
- Recipient of the 2024 Atkins Memorial Scholarship award (link incoming)
- First place winner of the 2022 TAS convention's Mathematics and Computer Science poster section (ask me about my grapes!)
- Captain of Southwestern University's track and field team

For more crazy factoids, here's my resume!
